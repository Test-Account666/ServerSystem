/**
 * UserManagerTest is currently disabled due to static initialization issues.
 * 
 * ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
 * The UserManager class has a static field `_CONSOLE_USER = new ConsoleUser()` that gets
 * initialized during class loading. This ConsoleUser constructor has complex dependencies:
 * 
 * 1. ConsoleUser -> loadBasicData() -> MappingsData.console()
 * 2. ConsoleUser -> ConsoleBankAccount -> ServerSystem.Instance.getEconomyProvider()
 * 
 * These dependencies are initialized before @BeforeAll can set up the necessary mocks,
 * causing static initialization failures.
 * 
 * POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:
 * 1. Refactor UserManager to use lazy initialization instead of static fields
 * 2. Use PowerMock or similar frameworks that can mock static initialization
 * 3. Create a UserManagerFactory that allows dependency injection
 * 4. Make ConsoleUser initialization lazy and mockable
 * 
 * CURRENT STATUS:
 * This test class is disabled until the architectural issues are resolved.
 * The UserManager functionality should be tested through integration tests
 * or by refactoring the class to be more testable.
