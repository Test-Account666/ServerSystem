ReplacedCommands:
  Enabled: false
  Description: >
    This config file allows you to replace one command with another.
    For example, if you have plugin xy and plugin yx registering the command `/god`
    and want to use plugin yx, but plugin xy takes priority, you can just configure a command replace.
    Notice: This does may work properly with commands registered by Essentials!
  Examples:
    Info: "The identifier can be anything. It's just for readability/error reporting."
    someIdentifierForYou:
      From:
        Info: "The 'From' command is the one you want to execute"
        Command: "god"
        Plugin: "WorldGuard"
      To:
        Info: >
          The 'To' command is going to replaced with the 'From' command
          Note that we don't need a 'Plugin' entry here as ServerSystem will replace the first command it finds
        Command: "god"
